    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    
    <div class="con">
     <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
        <li><span class="lt">Css is not neccesary</span> <span class="bg">CSS saves alot of work.</span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li><span class="italics">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
     </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    
    <div class="ul">
     <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style elements in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<span id="b1"> in this<br>
            tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier<br>
            for you to try it yourself. 
        </li>
     </ul>
    </div>
   
    <div class="par">
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also<br>
       special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript.
   </p>

   <p>In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of can be applied to the<br>
      element. 
   </p>

   <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
